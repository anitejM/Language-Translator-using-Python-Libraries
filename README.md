This is a Translator in an executable Python file.
I have utilised Tkinter and Google Translator Libraries, so make sure they are installed. You can use Command Prompt or PowerShell to install these.
You can use the pip command to install these libraries, by default pip is pre-installed with Python 3.4 and in later versions

Command to install tkinter: pip install tk
Command to install Google Translator: pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

After installing, simply run the Python file in an IDE or a terminal, then write your sentence in English in the box, select your language and press Translate to get the result.

You can customize the code and add or change the languages available in the menu.
Simply check the Google Language Code and change the name and language code given in the Python code.

For example if you want to add Telugu or Russian, write 'telugu : te' and 'russian : ru' respectively!
